# Gender-Classification-via-Convolutional-Neural-Network
•	Motivation: What problem are you tackling and why it is important to solve that problem?
•	Method: What are some of the AI or machine learning techniques/methods you are planning to use?
•	What are some of the experiments that you intend to perform?
•	Team member information

Please remember that you are free to choose a project of your choice. It is therefore recommended that you start early as it takes a lot of time and effort before one can finalize an idea. Further, if you are planning to use AI in your FYP then it might be a good idea to choose an idea related to your FYP so that you can test/experiment/explore ideas and technologies that you might use in your final year project

Part b) 

The progress report will be a short report consisting of at most two pages describing the overall progress in the project. For example if you are taking a machine learning based project then what dataset has been obtained, what code/notebooks are available online and what are some of the initial experimental results you have obtained.
 
It might be a good idea to pick an ongoing competition on Kaggle as your project as the dataset along with some online assistance will be available about that project.

Some of the online competitions and projects were introduced during the online lectures and if you are going to compete in such an online competition then you must include the details of that competition and various alternate methods for solving the problem and your suggested method.

Part c) 
A detailed report describing consisting of a detailed introduction of the problem along with details of your method and implementation details must be presented in the final report

Part d) 
The class projects will be presented as a poster (36in x 24in) along with a short recorded presentation video. Your work will be shared with your class fellows and you will be required to evaluate project presented by some of the other teams. You poster and report will be in PDF format and presentation  will be in the form of narrated slides or a video recording.
